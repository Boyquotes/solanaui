# SolanaUI

SolanaUI is a collection of beautifully designed UI components and utility functions, built for Solana. It extends the powerful [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library with Solana-specific components along with asset / price fetching utilites, making it easier to get started with Solana UI development.

## Getting Started

To get started read the [docs](https://www.solanaui.dev/) or install the docs locally.

### Installation

# install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Set your RPC url in your .env.local

```

### Development

```bash
# start development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. All SolanaUI components are stored in `src/components/sol` and utility functions can all be found in `src/lib`.
